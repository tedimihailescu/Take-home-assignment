1. Get data from at least 3 endpoints and insert them into 3 different Sqlite tables. Take into
account that an important step would be data normalization.
2. Demonstrate SQL Knowledge by executing scripts using connections initialized in the
python script.
3. Pandas Manipulation:
a. Convert the date and time to a datetime format
b. Calculate 2 KPIs using .agg in your DataFrame.
4. Sqlite
a. Create DB relationships between the tables within the python script
b. Demonstrate SQL knowledge by creating a report within the python script
Additional Information:
-UI is not necessary, the only material taken into consideration is the python script performing
the above requirements
- data normalization is a term used loosely in this instance thus its meaning remains relative to
the data set you decide on. For example, transforming nested json data into flat data could be a
step, n/a values handling could be another etc.
